<strong class="text-primary-dark mb-2 block">Remote Host</strong>
<p class="mb-3">
    The WP Private Plugin Manager communicates with a remote
    host server to retrieve information about the hosted plugins. This
    server-side component is responsible for serving plugin details to the
    WordPress admin interface.</p>
<strong class="text-primary-dark mb-2 block">Remote Host API</strong>
<p>The remote host API file, located in the WP Plugin Publisher directory, acts as the endpoint for plugin
    information. It responds to requests from the WP Private Plugin Manager and provides crucial data, such
    as
    plugin names, versions, and other relevant details.</p>
<strong class="text-primary-dark mb-2 block">Authentication</strong>
<p> Access to the remote host API is protected by a key to ensure security. Requests must include a
    valid
    key
    for successful communication.</p>
